          <p>At Upperline, we teach high school students how to turn their ideas into reality using the power of code. Our students build real apps, learn coding best-practices, and get exposure to the technology sector through guest speakers and company visits.</p>
          <p>Our immersive summer programs teach students how to build Web Applications using languages such as HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Javascript. We believe the only way to become a great developer is to tackle hard problems, become part of a community of learners, and develop a deep appreciation for the art of code.</p>
