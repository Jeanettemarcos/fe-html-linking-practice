# HTML Linking Labs

You have been hired as a freelance developer for Upperline's Heros page, but the site is a total mess. For one, there's hardly any content of the site, but more importantly, none of the links work!

## Instructions
Fork and Clone this lab, and then `cd` into the lab directory. Open up `upperline.html` in your text editor

### Step 1: Add in pictures for each hero.

Each section (or `<div>`) is dedicated to a different Upperline Hero. These are people who've done great things to advance computer science or technology over the past hundred years. For each person, **find an image online and add it in using the `<img>` tag.**

We've done one for you at the bottom (with cats), so that you have an example to work with.

### Step 2: Add in links to external sites

Link each person's name and image to their wikipedia page, using `<a href=>` tags. Remember anything inside of the `<a>` tags will get linked!

See the "Cats" Section for a good example.

### Step 3: Link to the More Info Page

Add a link to the "More Info" text at the bottom of the page that directs users to the `more-info.html` page in the project directory.

### Step 4: Bonus

Now that you have functioning links, put your HTML skills to the test with one of two options.

1. Go back to your 'hobby' page from the last session and flesh it out, adding more content using the tags below and a variety of links. OR...
2.  Continue working on this page, adding more information about Upperline (from your imagination is fine) using the tags below.

Here's a review of some of the HTML elements we've covered so far. If you'd like to see an example of them at work, just google the element. For example, if you want to learn more about the `<h3>` element, google "HTML h3 element"

List of HTML elements to use
+ `<img>`
+ `<a>`
+ `<div>`
+ `<p>`
+ `<ul>` and it's pal `<li>`. Google "html unordered list" if you need to see an example!
+ h1, h2, h3, etc.
+ `<title>` --- remember that the `<title>` tag goes in the head, not the body!!!
+ "Semantic" (meaningful) tags that don't add styling but help to organize your code. They also are useful for browsers that help the visually impaired `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`,  `<header>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<details>`
+ `<table>` (if you can stand a migraine; you'll probably need to google this one!)
